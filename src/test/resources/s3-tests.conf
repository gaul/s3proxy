## this section is just used as default for all the "s3 *"
## sections, you can place these variables also directly there

## replace with e.g. "localhost" to run against local software
host = 127.0.0.1

## uncomment the port to use something other than 80
port = 8081

## say "no" to disable TLS
is_secure = no

[fixtures]
## all the buckets created will start with this prefix;
## {random} will be filled with random characters to pad
## the prefix to 30 characters long, and avoid collisions
bucket prefix = s3proxy-{random}-

[s3 main]

## display name typically looks more like a unix login, "jdoe" etc
display_name = CustomersName@amazon.com

## replace these with your access keys

[s3 alt]
## another user account, used for ACL-related tests
user_id = 56789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234
